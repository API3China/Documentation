API3 is the native token of the API3 project. The API3 ecosystem is a single token environment. Check out the Medium post [API3 Tokenomics Update](https://medium.com/api3/api3-tokenomics-update-f032d6e49b30) for an in-depth overview on API3 tokenomics.

## Unstaked Tokens

Unstaked tokens are simply owned by an entity and do not generate revenue or have voting rights. They are subject to market value and inflation.

## Staked Tokens

Staked API3 tokens are used as collateral for the on-chain insurance service that will provide quantifiable and trustless security guarantees to dAPI users. These mechanics will remove the need for a central authority at the ecosystem level.

Staking simply means you are placing API3 tokens into the [DAO pool](dao-pool.md). When staking tokens to the DAO pool you gain access to weekly staking rewards but also share in the risk of dAPI insurance.
You are also granted voting rights on active DAO proposals and inflationary rewards.

To stake your tokens see [StakingTokens](./dashboard/staking.md). You can stake as many times as youâ€™d like. Your percentage of all the tokens in the DAO pool are directly related to your percentage of the rewards and the risks. If you stake 10% of the pool you earn 10% of rewards and will pay 10% of insurance claims.

## Governance

The only way to gain representation in the API3 DAO is to stake API3 tokens in the DAO pool.  Staked tokens give their holders the right to take part in the governance of the API3 ecosystem through the API3 DAO. To vote token holders must stake their API3 tokens in the DAO pool, which also gives them access to weekly staking rewards but also share in the risk of dAPI insurance.

All governing parties will be exposed to all risks and rewards of API3, and will govern to optimize them. Inflationary rewards and the staked tokens being used as collateral will create a positive feedback loop in terms of governance quality. Initial token holders will have to stake and expose themselves to risk if they do not want to lose value to inflation. If they misgovern and lose collateral through insurance claims, these tokens will get returned to the open market, from where they will be acquired by new governing parties. In contrast, if initial token holders govern well and cause token scarcity in the market, the representation distribution will be protected. In other words, governance tokens being used as collateral results in a robust Darwinian structure that improves itself and is able to recover from failures.
